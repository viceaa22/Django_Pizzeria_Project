We’ll write a web app called Pizzeria Project that allows users to 
create models with pizzas and add the topings they’re interested in 
and to make entries on the toppings they like
The Pizzeria home page will 
describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. 
Once logged in, a user can create new pizzas, add new toppings,
and read and edit existing entries.
